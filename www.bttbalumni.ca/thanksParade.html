<h1>Thanks for Signing Up</h1>
<p>
You can change your part at any time by returning to the parade page if you
wish, but you can only sign up for one part to play.
</p>
<p>
More information will become available as the parade date draws closer.
Don't forget the marching practice Friday night at 7 - you'll want the time to
get your legs back in shape, and remember which foot goes forward.

<p>
If you need an instrument, Long and McQuade in Burlington is offering a
rental program the alumni can take advantage of.
