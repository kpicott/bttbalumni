5	Weekend Tips	%0A%0D%0D%0D<p>%0A%0D%0D%0DIt's going to be a fantastic Homecoming weekend!  We kicked off%0A%0D%0D%0Dthe weekend on Thursday with the Boosters annual Big Swing Golf%0A%0D%0D%0DTournament which was a rousing success!  A great time was had by%0A%0D%0D%0Dall who attended.  We saw a large number of alumni on the course,%0A%0D%0D%0Dand everyone had their picture taken with CL Keedy, 2007 Rose Bowl%0A%0D%0D%0DPresident.%0A%0D%0D%0D</p>%0A%0D%0D%0D<p>%0A%0D%0D%0DThe toughest question raised though is... after winning the%0A%0D%0D%0DPutting Contest, how is Dave Wallace going to take the Beer%0A%0D%0D%0DFridge (full of beer) back to Dubai with him?%0A%0D%0D%0D</p>%0A%0D%0D%0D<h4>%0A%0D%0D%0DHere are a few reminders and pointers for you to have a fun and%0A%0D%0D%0Dsuccessful weekend.</h4>%0A%0D%0D%0D<ol>%0A%0D%0D%0D<li>   If you need any assistance with anything - look for the%0A%0D%0D%0DAlumni who have the Green nametags.  Those are members of the%0A%0D%0D%0DOrganizing Committees.  Ask them for help!  Alumni attending this%0A%0D%0D%0Dweekend's events will receive nametags on lanyards.  Thanks to%0A%0D%0D%0DCity Automotive of Burlington for their generous sponsorships of%0A%0D%0D%0Dthese lanyards.%0A%0D%0D%0D</li>%0A%0D%0D%0D<li>%0A%0D%0D%0DBand Boosters hosting BBQ at Central Arena during Friday night%0A%0D%0D%0DSocial Event The Band Boosters will be hosting a cash BBQ at%0A%0D%0D%0DCentral Arena during the evening.  Please support the band by%0A%0D%0D%0Dpurchasing a burger, sausage or hot dog at this BBQ.  All proceeds%0A%0D%0D%0Dwill of course be going back to the band.  Remember, there will%0A%0D%0D%0Dnot be chaperones around to give out Meal Money!  If you're%0A%0D%0D%0Drushing from work to make the 6:30 practice, you can skip supper%0A%0D%0D%0Dat home and buy a burger, hot dog or sausage at Central Arena.%0A%0D%0D%0D</li>%0A%0D%0D%0D<li>%0A%0D%0D%0DHere's something you won't remember from band days - a cash bar.%0A%0D%0D%0DWe will have limited capability for credit card transactions, so%0A%0D%0D%0Dremember to bring cash for your beverage tickets.  Any tickets%0A%0D%0D%0Dpurchased on Friday can also be used on Satuday.%0A%0D%0D%0D</li>%0A%0D%0D%0D<li>%0A%0D%0D%0DWe will be having ticket purchases at the door both Friday%0A%0D%0D%0Dand Saturday night so that nobody misses out on the great time.%0A%0D%0D%0D</li>%0A%0D%0D%0D<li>%0A%0D%0D%0DThe Alumni Band will be forming up by Central Arena to prepare%0A%0D%0D%0Dfor the parade. However, when the current BTTB steps off to start%0A%0D%0D%0Dthe parade at 11 AM, we'd love to see everyone at the New Street%0A%0D%0D%0Dentrance cheering on the band!  It's going to be a hot parade.%0A%0D%0D%0DRemember to wear sunscreen and your uniform ball cap. %0A%0D%0D%0D</li>%0A%0D%0D%0D</ol>%0A%0D%0D%0D	2007-06-15 00:00:00	1

90	A Band Member's Story	<p><i> %0A%0D%0D%0DI grew up in Burlington and attended a grade school where I was %0A%0D%0D%0Dlucky enough to have been given the chance to learn to play an %0A%0D%0D%0Dinstrument. My home life wasn't the greatest and money was usually %0A%0D%0D%0Dat the centre of the unrest. My father and mother fought a lot and %0A%0D%0D%0DI was always looking for a reason to get out of the house. When I %0A%0D%0D%0Dwas 13, a neighborhood kid took me to the Music Centre and I spent %0A%0D%0D%0Dmy first afternoon with the band. Soon I was a member. For the rest %0A%0D%0D%0Dof my teenage years I made music and especially dear to me, great %0A%0D%0D%0Dlife long friends. Although I know my parents could not afford to %0A%0D%0D%0Dsend me on tour I was always able to go. To those that made it %0A%0D%0D%0Dpossible all those years ago I say thank you.  %0A%0D%0D%0D</i></p> %0A%0D%0D%0D<p> %0A%0D%0D%0DThis story is as true today as it was when you were a band member.  %0A%0D%0D%0D</p> %0A%0D%0D%0D<p> %0A%0D%0D%0DWe all have a Baltimore tour, a Myrtle Beach, a Warren Ohio, a %0A%0D%0D%0DParade of Champions, a Rose, Cotton or Orange Bowl tour story to %0A%0D%0D%0Dremember or tell.  %0A%0D%0D%0D</p> %0A%0D%0D%0D<p> %0A%0D%0D%0DPlease help "pay it forward" %0A%0D%0D%0D</p> %0A%0D%0D%0D<p> %0A%0D%0D%0DLike the Bryan Adams hit "Summer of 69" "those were the best days %0A%0D%0D%0Dof my life" %0A%0D%0D%0D</p> %0A%0D%0D%0D<p> %0A%0D%0D%0DPlease consider making a donation to the Boosters to help make %0A%0D%0D%0Dmemories for a band member today.  <b>Alumni donations will go %0A%0D%0D%0Ddirectly to help a Band Member in need get to the next big tour</b>.  %0A%0D%0D%0D</p> %0A%0D%0D%0D<p> %0A%0D%0D%0DWays to donate: %0A%0D%0D%0D<ol> %0A%0D%0D%0D<li> Drop into the Music Centre for a visit!
