12859	My most vivid memory with the band was when we competed for the first time in the Philadelphia Parade of Champions Field Show Competition. it was the first time the band had ever done a field show competition, and we were very much the underdogs going into it.  With having woodwinds, we were the only "mixed" band performing, and were completely unlike the standard brass bands that were there, especially with playing Mr. Ford's amazing arrangements instead of traditional brass band marching music.  The rehearsals with Vince Bruni were always a lot of fun and he choreographed a fabulously unique routine for us.  The night of the show, I remember so clearly being lined up, shoulder to shoulder in this narrow hall, in very dim lighting.  We could see the bright spotlights far ahead and as our name was announced the roaring of the crowd (especially our chaperones) was huge.  We could barely hear Neal Sinclair as he gave the command for the drums to "count off" and when they started the fantastic drum solo that Mr. Ford had written, the sound of the drums reverberated off the walls and we could feel it go right through our bodies, becoming our heartbeat.  It gave us such an adrenaline rush and as we started to march in, the roaring of the crowd grew louder and louder.  I remember feeling so powerful as we went through the routine - we were "on" and nothing could stop us!  When we went into the "scatter" part of the show, and glided randomly around the arena, each time I went by someone, I could see the same incredible feelings in their eyes as I was feeling.  When we were in our final position and the last note ended, my eyes were filled with tears of pride as the cheering from the audience exploded in the hall.  It felt as if the roof would lift off from the sheer volume of it.  Way up in the rafters, I could see our chaperones waving Canadian Flags - my parents were there - my Dad being the Band Booster Treasurer (our "money man" for meal allowances), and my Mum - who was my group's chaperone on the tour. I knew we had made them and all the other chaperones proud and we could feel their love flowing down to us.  We knew we had done the very best we could and even if we didn't win the competition, we had given it our all, and represented Burlington proudly and with honour.  When we left the field and got through the doors into the waiting area and came to a stop, the entire band just exploded with cheers and hugs of happiness and victory.  It was agony waiting till the final results, and as we stood on the field with our fellow competitors I thought my heart would jump right out of my chest from beating so fast.  When I heard the words "Outstanding Performance Award and First Place to The Burlington Teen Tour Band", the tears started again and it was so hard to keep our "band face" on - we all had the biggest smiles just aching to come out. It was a remarkable experience and just one of the many wonderful memories I have tucked away in my heart of my years with the band.	1973-12-31 00:00:00	8	2006-11-08 22:12:17	0

18729	I can't.....I suspect this is a family page......However, the best friends I have in life and the fellows I still stay in contact with, are guys I met in the band!! The rogue's gallery of Jeff Allan, Gary Gentile, Bob Branch and Gary Plummer flood the memory with untold laughs and adventures; band related and otherwise. I look forward to rekindling old friendships and memories in June......All I can say is ......Buckle up!!	1971-06-15 00:00:00	10	2006-11-10 14:33:06	0
23885	I have so many fond memories it is hard to single out a few. Suffice to say that the experience was critical to my personal development - beyond music and marching. In the band I found a group of friends that I will cherish for the rest of my life. We competed, we laughed, we cried, we won, we grew. During my time in the band I met and had to learn to get along with many different kinds of people from many different backgrounds (well for Burlington). I might have been the most influential institution in my personal development. Thanks to everyone.	1981-06-15 00:00:00	12	2006-11-10 15:30:50	0
13427	I will always remember participating in the parades and tattoos in Holland during the 1997 tour.  The Dutch people were so excited to have us there that it made me profoundly proud of my country.  I felt honoured to be representing Canada in Europe.  It made history meaningful in a way it had never been for me before.	1998-12-31 00:00:00	13	2006-11-11 22:37:39	0
19493	The greatest memory I have had with this band was marching with the band during the Apledorn Parade in Holland. I had never seen a crowd be so involved and so enthusiastic when we came down the street. The Veterans clapped( In tempo!) with our music and it was a very emotional parade for me. I realised how important our Canadian veterans were and still are and how much they had done. It was also the last parade of 3 of my best friends in the band(we are still very close today) and I think I even cried more than they did when they left:) The tour to Holland was definately my favourite tour during my 5 years spent with the band and every time I think of that tour it reminds me of how fast life changes. The tour was right at the end of my senior year of highschool and it was at that time that I realised those would be the last moments of my "childhood" for I was entering adulthood very soon, graduating, going off to university , and leaving the band, which was very hard. For 5 years the band was one of the greatest things in my life and I do miss it very much, but I am VERY excited to come back and I AM SO PROUD of you guys for getting into the ROSEBOWL( me and another fellow alto sax friend of mine ALWAYS wanted to go , but we never went when we were in). Great job!  Any of you that are still in the band or have just joined, cherish every moment, because when its time to leave you will be asking yourself "where did those 5 years go?" Good LUCK!!!! God Bless:)	2003-06-15 00:00:00	15	2006-11-12 14:43:24	0
17847	My non-memory: What time does the bus leave for Red Deer? What do you mean we've been there and back??? WHERE DID I GET THESE PICTURES OF A GLACER??? WHAT'S GOING ON HERE????!!   I couldn't possibly narrow it down to just one. The band years made my teen years tolerable. Looking back I see where many of my current character traits were formed by the discipline, fun, tears and laughter while in the band. I'm looking forward to when my children (I have 4) are old enough to have the opportunity to join!	1979-06-15 00:00:00	17	2006-11-13 09:59:02	0

2961	The Burlington Teen Tour Band was one of the best things I have ever done and been a part of.  To this day, I continue to be in touch with my close circle of "bandies".  They are some of my nearest and dearest friends.  We lived a lifetime together during our years in the band.  I have so many memories which always bring a smile to my face.  This past summer I watched the band march in the Dundas Cactus Festival parade.  I was covered with goose bumps and my eyes filled with tears.  It had been many years since I had seen the band perform and I couldn't believe how emotional I got watching these young talented musicians proudly march up the street.  The memories flooded back as they played the Washington Post March, and before I knew it, I was humming my clarinet part as clearly as though it was yesterday when I last marched.

18685	I was in the original class over Ellerbecks store.  I went in the first day convinced I was going to be a drummer and much to my surprise came out with a cornet.  I remember our first parades, sharing a uniform with Dianne Saunders, our trips to Warren, Ohio.   A lot of great memories too many to mention!	1949-12-31 00:00:00	33	2006-11-14 17:27:56	0
None	I remember going to the USA on a trip to Elchart Indiana to a music iinstrument factory and traveling for a few nights and going through Warren Ohio and being billeted out with their members.I remember the Santa parades when we would do 2  parades a day and Orangville was always the snowiest and the most slush we would get soakers (wet feet).I remember doing the Boy Scout parade in Hamilton it seemed 5 miles long and we would rush back to the start double time marching so that we could do it again to many boy scouts and not enough bands.I remember in Toronto one year in the Graycup Parade a clown stuck a balloon down my sousaphone and we had to take the bell off in the parade because it was plugged up.I remember you would clean the mouthpiece in a big white bottle of alchol from the last person that used it!!I remember the day we turned the soil for the new band shell on New St we had the oldest band member he seemed like a 100 and the youngest band member some new young member on a bulldozer with Elgin turn the soil!I remember how cold it was and getting a day off school to lay the corner stone for the new hospital "Joseph Brant Hospital" not sure what year it was but it was a ways back!I am stopping now as I feel to damn old!	1962-12-31 00:00:00	35	2006-11-14 17:54:39	0

24018	There's so many I don't know which one!  How about the time during the Rose Bowl Parade (1980) that part of my baritone fell off! A little kid picked it up and gave it to Mr. Allen. Why did the brass have to play in front that year?  I enjoyed playing in the different places and seeing the sights! I think I saw more of the States living in Canada than I did living in the States!

7030	There was nothing better then a Baltimore tour. Spending the whole day going from parade to parade, standing to wait for our turn to start, no matter how long, proud in your uniform. I may have been tired after the third parade but you couldn't have paid me or made me drum major to sit down and forsake all those before me who sweated and played their hearts out for the red tunic. The last parade of the day was the best because your heart would swell up twice its size and try to push free from you throat as you rounded that last fimilar street. I remember playing my heart out being so proud. Proud of my self, proud of the band and so very proud of my coubntry. We were Canada's Musical Ambassadors. Those were the best days when you held on until that last corner, using up ever last it of what you had to keep playing as well as when you hit your first note of Strike Up the Band. I was even better the first time when I was a worm. I tried so hard to be worthy. Worthy of my section, worthy of my band. I remember tears of joy that used to come at the end of some of the longest parades as I saw the mace bottom above the heads of my commerades. I had not an ounce of seniority but I was eager to gain it, and be respected like I respected all the big kids on the end of the rows. I didnt resen't them, I idolised them and I tried so hard as best as I knew how to wear the tunic the way they did.I hold the red coat is such esteme, and every person to wear it with their head held high and instrument parallel to the ground.	1998-06-15 00:00:00	43	2006-11-14 23:45:15	0
10001	Standing on Juno Beach holding the Canadian flag at the front, watching the vets walk past us and listening to them. Near the end, as they started to go back up off the beach, one vet asked his friend jokingly, "Are we retreating from the beach?" His friend shot back "Never."It was touching and memorable and incredible. My really influential memories are from the 60th celebrations. (D-day and Liberation of Holland)At a really long and boring memorial service in a cemetary, the whole band was huddled outside the yellow tape, not really able to see or hear what was going on, but not wanting to be disrespectful. One of the vets came up to us because, as he explained, he thought these ceremonies were boring. His son seemed rather perturbed that his father would be ignoring the service to talk to a bunch of kids, but as a vet, he was beyond reproach!Anyway, this vet starts at the end of the tape and works his way along, telling a new story to each group, taking pictures and answering questions. The story I heard was about the burial practices for the soldiers. According to him, once you were dead they wrapped you in a blanket and put you in the ground, no coffin or cover.  The worst part was, the cost of the blanket came out of the soldiers pay!I really liked that he came over and took the time to chat with us. It was far more valuable than standing around and trying to pay attention to something we couldn't really hear.	2003-06-15 00:00:00	44	2006-11-15 00:51:44	0
16961	All of my memories of the band were special.  The one I remember with fondnest was the first time we went to Philadelphia and won 4 outstanding grades in the field show.  We were the first Band ever to achieve such high scores, and the first acanadian Band to compete. When the scores were read we were not allowd to respond outwardly but boy did we celebrate afterwards.  We were all so nervous but did a stupendous job.  The home coming was the most memorable . We arrived home by bus in Burlington at the Band Shell very late at night and were welcomed by hundreds of family and friends.  It was an experience of a life time.	1973-12-31 00:00:00	48	2006-11-15 17:02:31	0

Making lots of friends, the shopping and sightseeing, and, best of all feeling the "magic"! What an incredible tour!

We were all lucky to be a part of a band that travelled to so many fantastic places ~ what a way to see the world!	1988-12-31 00:00:00	51	2006-11-15 19:31:19	0

It was quite a trick.Will always remember Elgin Corlett teaching us to march outside Ellerbech's office behind the Coffee Pot. He would measure out 22" steps that we would have to march to. Also remember the bus ride to Kitchener(Kwannis) competition. Don't know why I remembered, I just do.Maurice Hines	1959-12-31 00:00:00	76	2006-11-22 22:51:18	0

6251	Spent many wonderful years in the early stages of the Burlington Junior Band when we started above Fishers Garage.  Elgin Corlett was the band director and he took us many wonderful places representing the Town of Burlington.  Usually it was Charlie Parsons as our head chaperone.  There were days we fainted in the extreme heat at the competition in Windsor on the July long weekend and then the next day paraded in the U.S. where is was pouring rain.  Our uniforms were ruined and we all got new ones.  We were so happy.  We were the only Canadian Band there and at the last minute before going in front of the judge's stand we changed the music.  We played "Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head" and we won the trophy.  When we came back to Burlington there was a street party waiting for us and we all had a wonderful time.  Each summer Elgin Corlett would switch places with the band in Burlington, Vermont and we got to stay with parents of that band for three weeks.  I was in the band when it went to the Rose Bowl for the first time.  These are only some of he memories. There are hundreds more.	1965-12-31 00:00:00	91	2006-11-29 23:07:15	0

26392	So many great memories, it is hard to chose just one so I won't!Being a member of the band consumed most of my teenage years, keeping me off the streets and at the band shell or walking the pavement in some city or town.My memoriies are of times together travelling and singing on buses, staying in hotels, school gyms and once an abandoned convent with ghosts.  Memories also include hanging out at the bandshell with friends who shared a common interest in music and performing.  We were "Band Kids", not a bad thing to be!Here are some of the key memories for me that stand out:North Bay Winter Carnival - alias "The Stay Awake Weekend" every year.Tournament of Champions in Philadelphia - We were the Champions!Cotton Bowl Parade in Dallas with snow on the parade day!Our excellent European adventure to England, Holland and Germany (lots of water on the boat as we crossed the English channel!)Wednesday nights and Sunday afternoons with the tallented and funny Mr. Ford.Hamilton Place concerts.Ontario Place weekends.Many laughs, wonderful lifelong friends and always great music!	1974-06-15 00:00:00	98	2006-12-03 15:54:12	0

26476	I was lucky enough to be in the band when we went out west to Alberta in 2001. We won numerous awards in the parades and fieldshow competitions there. It was an amazing experience. But also, being on Juno Beach with the veterans on the 60th anniversary of D-day.	2002-12-31 00:00:00	100	2006-12-04 17:28:09	0
12009	I would have to say that Calgary was one of the most memorable times in the Band.  We were gone for a total of 18 days, and I think that I had the most fun at this time.  Ya know sleeping in a gym with 200 people isnt that bad.  I had lots of great friends in the band, and Im glad that I still keep in touch with a few of them.  The band was a great experience and I'd do it all over again if I could!!	2001-12-31 00:00:00	101	2006-12-04 23:14:40	0
9813	There are obvioulsy so many memories, that it is darn near impossible to pick just one, but one of the first that comes to mind is this: When the Band was down in Miami, Florida for the 2003 Orange Bowl Tournament, we took part in a Field Show Competition.  I remember how nervous the Band seemed before we stepped onto the field. Nearing the end of our show, our conducting Drum Major at the time (Sarah McCleary) , looked out over the band and gave us a HUGE smile! It was just wonderful to see her so happy, and I felt that it gave the band that extra little boost near the finale. So thank you Sarah for making that a memorable moment for everyone who saw that!	2003-06-15 00:00:00	102	2006-12-04 22:22:51	0
10847	The best moment of being in the Burlington Teen Tour Band was my first parade. It was the only parade of the 2002 Myrtle Beach tour. I had an older sister in the band and so I knew that in most of Ontario the band was loved but I had no clue what to expect in the United States. I thought because we were a Canadian band playing in an American parade that we'd just be another band playing and passing by. For those of you who have been in the band you know what it feels like, "the magic" of the crowd cheering and the moment in time where you realize that this band is something really special. For those of you who have never been in the band, I can't describe it. The only word that comes to mind is magic. That memory will stay with me forever.	2003-12-31 00:00:00	103	2006-12-04 22:45:29	0
17885	My fondest memories were of Mr. Eric Ford.  His eloquence and love for music is something that I'm sure everyone will remember if you played in the band during his time as music director.	1973-12-31 00:00:00	107	2006-12-09 11:40:17	0
27323	There are too many special memories to narrow it down!!  How about passing out from heat exhaustion in Washington, or marching on the beaches in France with the vets or all the dances and fun on the back of the bus, how about the flood in Conneticut and winning the competition in Philledelphia.  But best of all arel the friendships forged along the way!!	1982-12-31 00:00:00	108	2006-12-10 20:09:06	0
27761	There were so many, but it was actually after I left the band.  It might have been 1974or 1975 and  I was working for Maple Leaf Coach Lines at the time.  As luck would haveit, I got to drive the Teen Tour Band to the Quebec Winter Carnival.  Maybe not a bigthing, but it sure felt good at the time.How about a little trivia?  Anybody remember how I got my nickname? Best regards"SHOW"	1967-06-15 00:00:00	109	2006-12-10 20:13:27	0
16957	I realize this is after I left the band but I believe it is an important memory for me. Returning to Burlington for Elgin Corlett's retirement dinner and having the opportunity to speak directly to him to thank him not only on my behalf but on behalf of all of the other band members whose lives he touched and influenced in such a positive way through his teaching and his generosity in sharing his talents and his very positive attitude.  It is something I have carried with me throughout my aduilt life.  I was one of the lucky ones who have had the opportuinity of becoming a professional musician employed in the RCMP Band for 30 years until it's demise and sharing music with people all across Canada as well as around the world and I attribute this special gift to him.	1960-12-31 00:00:00	110	2006-12-10 23:38:57	0

8	I will never forget our involvement in the 50th D-day celebration in Apeldoorn Holland in 1994.  I will forever have utmost respect for the Canadians who fought in the war and for the Dutch citizens for treating us so kindly during our stay. To this day the song Highland Cathedral sends chills down my spine and reminds my of the bands time in Holland.   A truly remarkable experience!	1995-12-31 00:00:00	119	2006-12-19 22:27:37	0

18724	04 July 1972 (?) - Wyndotte, Michigan (?):  It was the last parade of our annual Windsor/Detroit International Freedom Festival tour.  We were approaching the reviewing stand when the heavens opened up.  A torrential downpour.  The music order was changed at the last minute and we played "Raindrops" (and they kept falling and falling and falling) in front of the judges - each and every one of us drenched to the bone.  We won another trophy (or two) and what a fitting send off for those old tunics.	1972-12-31 00:00:00	133	2006-11-14 17:28:39	0
26086	The memory I have that has stayed with me is all the friends that I made while in the band.  Like most things inmy life I was the one to look after everyone earning me the nickname of MOM.  we had some great times after drum practice on Monday nights just hanging in the band shell and doing nothing.  The back of bus3 just being silly listening to loud music and singing along so badly I often wondered how some of you could play music, you seemed tone deaf!  Winning competitions and parades wasn't  everything, and the friendships sure were awesome.	1980-12-31 00:00:00	137	2006-11-16 00:07:07	0

39	In 1966 our family still lived in Timmins and we always watched the Rose Bowl Parade.I remember saying to my parents ,that someday I would watch the Parade live from L.A.  Little did I know that less than a year later I was moving to Burlington ,starting high school and joining the band that would be invited to march in the Rose Bowl Parade.My memories of learning an instrument and fund raising buy selling roses to defray some of the costs for the First Time the Band marched in Pasadena are very dear to me.	1970-06-15 00:00:00	142	2007-01-08 15:32:10	0
40	the whole time i was in the band was special... i met my wife through the band,  met many of my friends (many of whom are still close friends), learned how to play music, (something i am fortunate to still do to this day) and learned how to travel (also something i still do a fair amount of)....  the band was sort of a way of life for us (my sister was a drum major, and my parents were active boosters), and i can't really picture my teenage years without it...	1994-12-31 00:00:00	143	2007-01-08 18:57:01	0
41	My entire experience during my teenage years in the band is unforgettable.  I am so proud of the person I've become today and I owe a lot of that to the BTTB.  I met my husband while in the band, and some of my best friends today, I grew up with in the band as well.  I am so honoured to have been a part of something as great as this organization and I look forward to seeing everybody again at the 60th Anniversary	1993-12-31 00:00:00	144	2007-01-08 19:15:30	0

47	When the band traveled to France for the D-Day celebrations in 2004, a group of friends and I sat down to eat lunch at a restaurant a few minutes from the gym. After enjoying a nice meal outside, we asked the waiter for the bill. Unfortunately, 11 years of French immersion seemed to fail us at this point because what was supposed to sound like biet (an attempt to ask for the bill...) sounded a little more like beer to the French waiter, who was startled to see the look on our faces when he brought 6 cold ones back to the table. He was also startled to see the expressions of the 10 boosters who happened to be a couple tables down, and situated in just the right place to see exactly where the tray of beer was going. Fortunately, we sorted out the language barrier issue with the waiter and we had a good laugh for the rest of the tour.	2004-12-31 00:00:00	150	2007-01-11 19:07:46	0
6756	I can remember wearing garbage bags under my uniform and stuffing those horrid smouldering sticks into my gloves to try to avoid frostbite while my sax's pads froze and my mouth stuck to my metal mouthpiece on those long winter parades that just never seemed to end. Conversely, I can remember watching with an almost morbid fascination those members that began swaying and then came crashing to the ground under blistering summer suns. Every parade was measured by how hot, how wet or how cold it was...and how we survived against the elements. There are so many memories tand too numerous to list but some jump out at me and, I am sure, to others. 'Mad Mary' literally and figuratively pushing her yellow rocket through CNE traffic, fireworks from Myrtle Beach, the infamous scramble at Tiger Stadium, wine poured in my sax along the Montreal Grey Cup parade route...and those terrible 'Wendy's' outfits the majorettes had to wear. I remember Trudeau just 10 feet away from me delivering an electrifying speech at the Hamilton Convention Centre and Terry Fox entering the RBG complex to a hero's welcome. I remember the Governor General's home and the welcome we received throughout Europe. I remember Philly, the police escort on the parade route in Bridgeport, Conn. and the vicious Florida sunburns so many of us foolishly endured in Dunedin. I remember Mickey Mouse without his head in the performers' area at Disneyland and, of course, the Rose Bowl Parade. I remember the words "You ding ding" and "Use your head for something more than a hatrack" and I dreaded the word 'romano'. I also remember being at the music center almost every day for a period of years, whether it was Dance Band, Salon Group, Concert Band, sax sectionals, my music lesson with Mr. Allan, Dixieland Band or, of course, the Marching Band. Whether I was playing, conducting or writing music, it did not matter what I was doing. I was at band and that was all that mattered. But what I can't remember and what I can only see now is how the band shaped and moulded so many people and brought so much success to so many later in life. I look back to those years with great fondness and many memories but mostly with deep gratitude. Thank you BTTB and thank you to those that I had the honour to share that experience with.	1981-06-15 00:00:00	154	2006-11-15 09:51:30	0
4594	My favourite memory of the band was during our tour to Ireland.  Some of the girls  sneaked into our friends room just before curfew.  Given that these friends were boys, this was not a smart move.  Upon hearing chaperones coming to do a room check, the boys insisted we hide on the open window sil, behind heavy curtains.  Apparently one of my shoes was visible, and one of the guys (I wont mention names) told me to hide the shoe and gave me a little shove.  Being a clutz, I fell out of the window onto the roof.  Luckily it was a short fall and when the chaperone came into the room, all he could here was giggling from what sounded like another room with an open window.  The boys (our dear friends) were so afraid of being caught, they did not offer to help retrieve me from the roof below.  I was stranded for about 15 minutes until a very kind drum major (I wont mention names) hauled me in through his window and sent me back to my room.	1989-06-15 00:00:00	156	2006-11-15 09:31:12	0
52	At the time I was in the band there were only 4 or 5 of us in the colour guard.  As we marched along a street in Oakville, the two guys beside me noticed a couple of good looking girls on the porch ahead.  As the rest of the band turned right as per Elgin Corlett's instructions, the two gazers marched straight on past the girls!  The whole band was in hysterics!!	1966-06-15 00:00:00	157	2007-01-12 17:32:11	0

The time I spent with the band enabled me to go on and teach several bands and drum corps, helping to instill positive values to another generation of young performers while being able to help them attain, Provincial and National titles.	1987-12-31 00:00:00	159	2006-11-09 10:15:01	0
26512	Being apart of the 60th Anniversary of D-Day was something that I will never forget.  To have been so lucky to be part of the band and have such an amazing oppurtunity is a blessing.  Being apart of the trip to France was certainly memorable as well.  I had my seventeenth birthday during the trip and on the same day we went to Paris!  With the band I shared experiences on that trip that only those in the band will have.  France, and then travelling to Holland again for such important events, to commerate the war and our veterns will stay with me forever.	2003-12-31 00:00:00	163	2006-11-18 14:49:33	0

4274	Ireland 1988.  My name is Shannon, I have an Irish heritage and my birthday is on St. Patrick's Day.  I spent my 18th birthday marching in the St. Patrick's Day parade in Dublin, Ireland.  That is still a life highlight for me.  I made some really great friends while I was in the band.  Sadly I lost touch with so many.  I remember each and every one of them fondly.  They, along with the 5 years in the band helped shape the person I am today.	1986-12-31 00:00:00	173	2006-11-14 22:48:16	0
67	Special memory... there are way too many to pick just one.  Seeing the world and learning some very important life lessons thanks to friends of the past is number one on my list.  I would love to connect with those people once again and see where life has taken them. Number one lesson learned is that Karma comes around full circle so always be on your best with a positive outlook on life.	1994-12-31 00:00:00	174	2007-01-19 11:55:29	0

Remember fabulous trip to Elkhart, Indiana (kinda pales in comparison to later trips).  Remember .... Greg Haber, Carolyn Cutt, Jim Blake, Alfie Smith, John Hoover, Haber girls, Gord Price, Tim Burke, Ken Pridmore.....and I married (very happily! for 37 yrs.)

80	A real great event we had near the end of my time with the band was when we put together a BTTB hockey team and played against some Hamilton celebrity/radio personality team at Central Arena.  I particularly remember Mr. Wilk getting us out to Cootes Paradise on a frozen pond for hockey practice.  All in all, every aspect of my time in band is a special memory.	1979-06-15 00:00:00	184	2007-01-23 16:43:39	0
5	One of my favourite memories of my time in the band was the bus ride crossing back over from France to England at the end of the D-Day+60 tour in 2004.  The whole tour was incredible, but the all night dance party on the bottom of the double decker bus wiith the disco lights was the best part, it was also the last tour that alll of my main group of friends went on together.	2002-12-31 00:00:00	185	2007-01-24 17:25:04	0
11	I was always proud of the music we played on parade. It was popular music that the crowds would sing along with. Mr Ford's arrangements were amazing. Band practice was always fun. I still remember the "Mr. Fordisms"; such as "what are you.....Russian?", when our tempo got too fast, or "this is when the lightening hit the outhouse" when the music demanded some energy from us.	1974-12-31 00:00:00	190	2007-01-28 09:06:42	0

I also appreciate all of the hard work and planning that Bob Webb, Eric Ford and many others did for us!	1977-06-15 00:00:00	191	2007-01-28 20:05:53	0

I also remember the fun on the smaller ones like Vermont, North Bay, Quebec and even Ontario Place. After 4 years in the Peanut Band, my first performance with the BTTB was Ontario Place, June 1973. Two of us "new guys" decided to get on the bus that was loaded with pretty girls (the colour guard bus) for the trip to T.O. As we neared T.O. a voice called out "we are running late everyone, out of your clothes and into your uniforms." Hello! Welcome to the big band!!	1973-05-15 00:00:00	210	2007-02-14 13:15:40	0

63	Like any new band member, I was very nervous and excited to march in my first parade, the Niagara Grape and Wine Festival.  But what was this? No change rooms? I awkwardly tried to change into my band pants while remaining seated on the old small school bus and hoping that the rest of the band members wouldn't see me.  But, after my first tour to Quebec City for the winter carnival, I felt quite at home being a band member.   I had made new and lasting friends (one of which I married) and had shared many memorable events with them through parades, performances and tours.  Even after we had left the band, the BTTB Colour Guard and Drum Majors made a special apprearance at Carolyn and my wedding.  And now that our daughter has joined the band, I still feel at home; again.  But I am still a little concerned that band members, and my daughter, are getting changed together on the bus!	1978-06-15 00:00:00	224	2007-02-19 22:36:00	0
129	Where do I begin with all the memories I've shared -  our bus rides were fun (intermediate bus that is) and our trip up to North Bay in the freezing cold, toboganning and Lemon Gin (YUK!!!) can't have any till this day....LOTS OF FUN!!!	1971-06-15 00:00:00	225	2007-02-20 19:27:31	0
17493	Its hard to pick just one favourite moment of my band career. Probably the most sentimental was being on Juno Beach when the vets when back down there. It was so emotional and moving. One of my favourite 'fun' memories was all the movie shoots and meeting Ray Romano and Gene Hackman. That was pretty cool! I still have their autographs kicking around somewhere!	2001-12-31 00:00:00	228	2007-02-22 13:50:12	0
19127	Quebec and North Bay winter carnivals, trying to keep the valves from freezing(impossible!!) Baking in the heat at the American Bi-Centennial parade in Washington D.C.

149	My best memories from my high school days are definitely band memories.  The ones that come to mind most are from the Holland trip ( I went on the second one, I believe it was in 1997), when a small group of us stayed at the "police academy" in Apeldoorn.  We were all friends.. and we just had a blast.  I'll never forget it!	1997-12-31 00:00:00	242	2007-02-26 15:20:09	0
152	Where to begin ...  there isn't just one stand out moment, but when I think about my time in the band I always come back to all the moments with my closest friends and all the reasons why became close friends. Like putting underwear and bras in your hostel window in Holland or trading your piccolo for a set of quad drums (still a very bad trade Peter) or side-sipping or long bus rides and even longer wait times and all the things we'd do to amuse ourselves in between. Getting angry at other sections over things that were really important at one point in time and now seem endlessly stupid, cheers about garbage, self-appointed bus captainships, "one more round for the bus driver!", late nights in Baltimore, even later nights in Myrtle Beach, "ham and cheese or perhaps the monkey ball soup?", and of course trying to determine who's "onion" looks best when marching.  Yes, we went to great places and had amazing life experiences, but these are the moments that always put a smile on my face.	1995-06-15 00:00:00	246	2007-02-28 16:03:40	0
153	I guess my favourite memory of my time in the band, would be our trip to France. We were on a day trip to Paris, and aside from thinking how bad the French are at driving, I remember standing on top of the Eifle Tower thinking how incredible this is and that the only reason I was able to be here was because of the band.	2004-12-31 00:00:00	247	2007-02-28 16:45:36	0
154	I don't have one single memory from band that I can call my favorite, because there are too many moments, good and bad, that I've been through with the band that have made me the person that I am today.  The confidence, leadership skills, musical skills, and dedication that I learned in my almost five years with BTTB will stay with me forever and I know for a fact that I would not be doing the things I am doing in my life right now if it were not for the band, it's members, and most importantly, the instructors.  Thank-you for all the support, love, and laughter that was constantly provided, and congratulations on 60 years of a wonderful band!	2003-12-31 00:00:00	248	2007-02-28 22:48:13	0

157	A special memory?  I had a great time, from beginning to end.   One thing I remember, and that's how Glenn Shaw got the nickname Show (have a look at Glenn's entry).  The people who compiled the band list always listed him as "Show, Glenn" in the trumpet section.   Are you sure your real name is Shaw?  The band list always managed to get Greenhow right, and I have to tell you, not many people can do that.  Also, I remember that you had an exquisitely engraved Zippo lighter with the name Show etched into it.	1969-12-31 00:00:00	250	2007-03-01 14:51:35	0

86	when i think of my band career, i become overwhelmed with blissful memories.   Some of my favourite memories are of when we went to France and Holland. Being on the beach with the veterans and seeing the expressions on their faces is something i will never forget.  The trip to Holland was my last tour and being there meeting/ talking to the veterans was very memorable.  As well, the trip to Amsterdam was awesome, some good fun memories there with all my friends.  To this day it's hard to believe that i even went to any of those places with the band and shared all of the special moments with them.  The Bus rides were especially fun!! Always something interesting happening on the bus...and the Christmas parades, i always looked forward to doing them!  I am truly glad i had joined band, its one thing i will never forget. It was and honour to be a part of a big family and to have known such  excellent musicians.	2003-12-31 00:00:00	255	2007-03-03 20:56:19	0
126	Marching up Brant Street in our civies (our uniforms were soaked) following muliple wins on our Windsor tour.  The people of Burlington were all our cheering for us and were so proud of our accomplishments.  Many tears.  ... in Detroit...The judges loved our rendition of Raindrops as we marched through the pouring rain and I seem to recall some pretty wet accommodations on this trip.   Too many great memories to pick!	1971-06-15 00:00:00	258	2007-03-04 13:09:35	0
146	Getting my first french horn in Mr. Allan's Office.  The silver Alexander double which has inspired me to become the professional musician I am today.  My first Parade- Rob walking behind me and 'kindly' telling me what foot I should be putting forward.  Grape and Wine- the grape stomping behind the band centre Getting burnt at Band Camp.  I still am more tanned on parts of my arms from that summer!  Discovering the world.  Exploring who I was and who I wanted to be.  It was often through trial and error that I had these personal discoveries.  But I also had much encouragement, guidence and love from my friends and colleagues, parents of other participants and staff of the Band.	1996-12-31 00:00:00	260	2007-03-04 17:52:50	0
169	I was in the Band for a short time, but I have so many great memories and so many friends today that I continue to see from Band. I feel so fortunate to have had this experience in my life and to have the wonderful friendships as a a result of being in Teen Tour. My special memory would have to be the England France tour for the 40th Anniversary of D-Day.  It was such an amazing tour. To be in the countries where so many young soldiers losts their lives for our freedom today. It was a life changing experience I will never forget. I will always remember carrying the Canadian flag and being so proud to represent Canada as a member of the BTTB.	1983-06-15 00:00:00	263	2007-03-07 22:52:49	0

186	The years studying under Elgin Corlett inspired me to eventually get into music education again, 37 years ago in the Los Angeles area, after touring the USA with various bands.  The trips to Warren Ohio and the Warren G. Harding High School return trips to Burlington are the most memorable events.	1953-12-31 00:00:00	271	2007-03-13 15:26:25	0
164	My memories with this band are just so incredibly numerous.  By far the most influential tour for me was Holland 95.  After one of the Canadaian Cemetary performances, I actually struck up a conversation with a Canadian veteran who was now living in Holland with his Dutch wife, but who had served in the war with the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry. Part way through the conversation he said "this is a long shot, but do you know a Ken Skerrett? I foight along side him near the start of the war, and I have been wondering all these years if he made it out." I was so incredibly able to reply, "he's my Grandfather."  The band made possible this moment.	2007-03-14 00:00:00	272	2007-03-14 21:27:12	0
164	Watching the band of 2002 perform the Space themed fieldshow at the Calgary Stampede...after SO much work and a terrible rehearsal the day before, the band nailed it so perfectly. I remember peeking out from behind the wall at the edge of the Saddle Dome with Rob, Trevor and Bill (Jeff was at home with Amy having baby #1!), just hysterical and so excited. I remember trying to control the band to keep their composure and "be professional and humble" when we KNEW we'd cleaned up.	2007-03-14 00:00:00	273	2007-03-14 21:34:56	0

None	Playing in the Teen Tour Band changed my life as it instilled in me a special relationship with music and people.  Under the management of Bob Webb, I saw what could be accomplished if a group of people share a unified direction.  Eric Ford was a complete musical wizard and his approach to brass playing is still with me as I play in Dubai.Best time....1975 European Tour....a chance to start to see the world!Looking forward to seeing everyone in June.	1973-06-15 00:00:00	276	2007-03-16 13:55:41	0
18811	My first parade was the Quebec Winter Carnival.  Everytime we stopped, the crowd poured wine into the drummers from these red plastic canes and I thought, this marching band stuff is great (it must have planted the seed for later Top Hat antics).  I can't forget Bob's "hurray up and wait" management style, Eric's fantastic arrangements, sneaking out of hotel rooms across the balconies (who put the soap in the fountain on the US bicentennial tour, was it the now Rev. Katz?), getting cold chills at the first beat of the Philly shows, having security chase me and Nipper backstage at Disney World for taking forbidden photos, the "senior click", running over field judges while carrying Big Ben - all good memories, great friends and I ended up with a wife (I thought I'd better stick that last one in as the best memory!)	1976-12-31 00:00:00	277	2007-03-17 14:53:00	0

9675	Some of my fondest memories are with my other family, the Burlington Teen Tour Band. From my first Christmas parade season in 1973, my first gym tour in 1974 and the coldest parade of all time for me (The Quebec Winter Carnival), all the way to the Rose Bowl on New Years Day in 1980, there would be WAY too many things to list down here and talk about. Now as an Instructor with the BTTB Drumline, I get a chance to relive and soak up that atmosphere all over again. When I go into the rehearsal hall, I need to rub my eyes and blink a couple of times because as I watch these young and talented musicians staring at the music, concentrating and learning, I can see faces of the people I was in the band with. It was said to me that “Once you join the Band, you never really leave the Band”, that’s true. Spring 2007 should be a blast, I hope everybody is going to be in the mood for the biggest group hug of all time.	1977-06-15 00:00:00	279	2007-03-18 21:54:44	0
19757	My memories are of bus 3 and the gang at the back. We had great times and as much as the chaperones thought we were bad, we were harmless (well....).

25488	I will always remember my first band practice and being chosen to stand up in front of the band to play with others from all sections of the band. Mr. Ford always did this when we were learning new music. It was a good way to learn it quickly and properly. The Philly Parade of Champions experience (3 times) including Vince Bruni's incredible skill (and patience) at teaching us marching and manouevering. The James Street Armory practices before school were a pain but we knew how important they were. Rosie O'Gradies Good Time Emporium in Orlando (Thanks for taking us there Bob). Bus trips whether to Oakville or Dallas were the best. Sitting with Roy Russell as he 'drove' the school bus backwards thinking the buses on either side of us were going forward. The 1980 Rose Bowl Parade was incredible. I look forward to watching my own children as they march in the 2008 Rose Parade.	1972-09-10 00:00:00	286	2007-03-10 00:00:00	0

227	The years I spent in the band were some of the best years of my life. The majorettes always had dance routines for the concerts . Watching the faces of the little children when we were in the Santa Claus parades always brought a smile to my face. I have wonderful memories of travelling with Charlie Parsons and many others . I remember someone often saying " Majorettes are a dime a dozen so hurry up and get your girls lined up " . My last parade was the first time we went to the Tournament of Roses.  What a way to go out ! Looking forward to seeing long time ago friends , not " old " friends.	1964-12-31 00:00:00	297	2007-04-09 19:19:39	0

242	Summer parades were memorable for the dampness of the T-shirt after a couple of hours in a warm wool redcoat, but in this case we were overheated before we even started marching. We were in Washington D.C. for the USA Bicentennial parade on July 4 1976. It was hot and sunny as July 4 should be, and the air conditioning failed on our coach. The parade marshals, assisted by the US military, wanted everyone to stay on the bus until the last possible minute before lining up to march. We were sweltering in the coach, and the chaperones pleaded with the marshals to let us off to get some fresh air. Eventually the marshals relented, and we found some shade with the Wahsington Monument visible in the distance. Since it was a holiday weekend, there was nowhere open to get the bus repaired, so we drove all the way back to Burlington with one of the emergency exit windows propped open to get a breeze while on the road.	1976-06-15 00:00:00	304	2007-04-15 22:23:14	0

Is this Space Mountain?" - chant on busses to Disney World. "The Originals" first performance with Todd McKay (Bass) and Jeff "Tombo" Tomblison (Drums) at a BTTB dance; I still play some of "The Originals" songs.

3042	Growing up in the band (12-12) I learned a lot about people, places, events, marching & music.  If not for my involvement with the bttb I wouldn't have been able to establish the CLH Drum Corps.  I've always been told I am my fathers daughter, so I follow in his footsteps.  I will always remember the friends made, times shared      (good & bad), lots of 1st ( 1st D-Day, 1st 5 year rings, 1st winter guard etc.), and the effect both then & now on people when I tell them that I marched with the bttb.  However, besides all of this my most cherished memory has to be that it was a family affair (Mr.G, Chris (percussion) & mom cheering us on). I shall always fondly remember this time in my life ( there's not enough space for the amount of memories I have), and do you remember " not til we're in a box"	1977-09-30 00:00:00	321	2007-04-23 21:59:19	0
264	There were just so many...I'm so grateful to have met such fabulous people through the band.  Those band camp weekends were a killer though!  I'll never forget being very new to the colour guard and passing out during band camp and waking up inside some trailer!  I appreciate the values that were taught to us in those days and feel that they really helped to create who I am today.	1985-12-31 00:00:00	323	2007-04-25 03:15:32	0

None	My proudest memory was in Michigan for the Cherry Festival. After not even placing in the first two competitions. In the third parade we stopped right before we entered the judging area, turned to the judges and proudly played O' Canada. I have never been more proud to be a member of the band or a Canadian. And it didn't hurt that we took 2nd place for that parade.	2006-06-15 00:00:00	326	2007-04-26 17:07:15	0

4931	My first parades were in Baltimore. I felt so proud when i finished that fourth parade in one day, and the feeling i got from marching was indescribeable.  In France when I was with Glen Thomson, Kyle Unelli and Sarah Nault and we got lost, and Glen asked a pigeon which way the Eiffel Tower was, and when the pigeon flew away, it actually showed us the way back. When Geoff Tennant almost choked to death on a baguette in France, and will not eat baguettes to this day. On Juno Beach withthe Vets, and in Holland, something I pray I will never forget. My last parade with the band, Burlington X-mas, when four of the seven(ish) people I joined with, quit. The feeling of leaving was so overpoweringly sad (yet exciting) that I have never felt anything like it.All in all, there were ups and downs, there were lots of "band relationships/boyfriends"....but at the end we were/are still a family.	2003-12-31 00:00:00	329	2007-04-30 14:27:12	0

283	Without a doubt, it's the friends that made it great.  Most memorable parades were the American Bicentennial Parades in Philly and Washington.  Those Americans sure know how to celebrate!  They went wild when we played the present day songs like The Hustle and Swat and other Eric Ford arrangements.  I also remember a  special fundraiser:  the Teen Tour Drum-a-tho  .  Keven Bushell got busted before he could completely rearrange the City of Burlington's display board.  A valient effort though.	1978-12-31 00:00:00	335	2007-05-05 11:29:56	0
23999	I will never forget being with the band in Juno Beach for the 60th Anniversary of D-Day.  That was a life-changing experience and I'm so glad I got to be a part of such a momentous occasion.	2001-12-31 00:00:00	336	2007-05-07 14:24:27	0
284	Too many memories to write in this wee window. Participating in the Juno Beach ceremonies and the festivities for the liberation of the Netherlands were definately highlights as well as the Orange Bowl in Miami. Other memories include being called "Grandma" by the gals, dropping my sax just minutes before stepping off in the Orange Bowl parade, the ticket blitz fundraiser experiences (Liz you know what I'm talking about...) and thinking I had worn Stefan's band pants during one of the parades. Oh the memories!!	2003-12-31 00:00:00	337	2007-05-07 19:18:19	0
287	When I went to Calgary, it was the first time I developed the nickname: "19". Trevor King, along with many friends and Band Management would call me it, because of my mom. On this tour my mom was paranoid that I'd lose things, so EVERYTHING had "19" on it (my band number), so it would not get stolen or lost. And by everything I mean regular socks and band socks (in fabric paint), bags, underwear, even the heels of my shoes. Even today some of my socks still have "19" (with an underline so you don't think it's 61), because I can't bring myself to throw them out.	2002-12-31 00:00:00	339	2007-05-09 13:05:47	0
291	The twinkle in Mr. Ford's eyes; Sorting the music in his basement with "Cool Newell"; Fun at Mr. Ford's "Free for All" sessions in the summer; Giggling A LOT; Lifelong friends; Mom and Dad always available to drive me to my many practices	1973-06-15 00:00:00	340	2007-05-11 10:57:11	0
292	No one special memory.  The band was a great experience at that stage of my life.  It consisted of a great bunch of people, and we all had a lot of fun as well as hard work.  All my memories of the band are happy ones.  Elgin Corlett deserves special mention -- he was a great leader.  Sorry I am out of town on the anniversary weekend and will not be able to attend.  Hi, to all my friends.	1949-06-15 00:00:00	341	2007-05-11 12:20:08	0
293	I have so many good memories of my time in the band that it is impossible to pick just one.  Although, being in the Rose Bowl parade was pretty exciting, as was meeting Alan Thicke (the actor) on the plane on the way to California.  I met a lot of great people and had a lot of fun.  The only regret I have is not saying in touch with every one.	1986-12-31 00:00:00	342	2007-05-11 23:06:23	0

296	I had and we truly blessed to have traveled with the band To England and France in 1984 to celebrate the 40th Anniversary of D-Day. I was so proud to be a Musical Ambassador from Canada. To see with my own eyes the beaches of Normandy, Flanders Field, Unmarked Canadian Soilders who fought and died for our freedoms and liberties. I have those memories and others that I will remember for all of my life! God bless this wonderful organisation! :o)	1984-06-15 00:00:00	344	2007-05-14 09:51:27	0
None	I was truly blessed to have been part of the BTTB. I had the chance to travel to England and France to celebrate the 40th Anniversary of D-Day. I was so proud to be a Musical Embassdor representing our great nation of Canada. To see with my own eyes the beaches of Normandy, Flander field and the row upon rows of fallen soldiers who fought for our freedoms and liberties! I have many other wonderful memories from my time with the BTTB that I will always remember all of my life! God Bless this wonderful organization! :o)	1984-06-15 00:00:00	345	2007-05-14 10:18:38	0
297	Alot of memories.... laughter, long practices, and good friends.  Most memorable were Eric Ford's music arrangements.   Enjoyed trips to Philly, Washington DC Bicentennial, Quebec winter carnival, and Miami Orange Bowl.  Still love to watch the band when I get a chance.	1976-06-15 00:00:00	346	2007-05-14 21:36:07	0
298	The band for me is all about the lasting friendships that were developed.  Memorable trips include bus trips to Williamsburg, Lake Placid, Canada Day celebrations in Ottawa and the 1980 Rose Bowl Parade.	1979-12-31 00:00:00	347	2007-05-17 09:52:12	0
299	the Rosebowl Parade was spectacular.  The crowds who had lined up for hours cheered and applauded us over the entire route.  i was never so proud to be a Canadian as i was at that event!	1979-12-31 00:00:00	348	2007-05-17 10:07:42	0
300	I loved the Cotton Bowl Parade and the competition we did in Phili - where we WON it all!! very nice!!It was a wonderful organization -- after moving up to  Canada from North Carolina - where marching bands were the bomb -- it was great to find something like this in our new city!loved all the xmas parades too!	1972-12-31 00:00:00	349	2007-05-17 23:22:04	0

143	First of all, the Teen Tour Band is where I met my husband (Dan Sivyer, Tuba/Sousaphone). I met so many people during my time in the band and made many friends over the course of five years. The trips were awesome....experiences I would never give up if I had to do it all over again. As a clarinet player being placed in the middle of a line of trumpets for my first field show position .... very intimidating. Standing at attention for what seemed like hours but probably only 10-15 minutes. Hurry up and wait. My opportunity to volunteer for 4 years with the Junior Redcaots on Saturday mornings...just too many memories to mention.	1995-12-31 00:00:00	356	2007-05-24 12:26:30	0
252	Marching in my first parade, feeling the beat of that excellent percussion section, and brimming with pride as I felt part of something special.  I'll also never forget having the opportunity to travel to Europe,  forming some great friendships, many I'm fortunate enough to still have today.  I also get a bit of grin when I recall driving a borrowed bike across the Dutch country side, Jeff Branch riding on the handle bars, both of us out a bit late.	1974-08-15 00:00:00	357	2007-05-24 22:43:07	0
None	Meeting my husband, Joel Haynes, is a memory which stands out for me.  I never thought at the time that my choice in a husband would begin with witnessing him moon the Luxembourg Palace in Paris; getting squished at the bottom of one of his "pile on" ideas; watching him put out mysterious flames on the beach in Myrtle Beach; getting his swim suit pulled down to his ankles by Paul Hill at the English Channel in Caen (oh, my); or experiencing his Hawaiian shirt and shades on bus #3 EVERY time we passed a "South of the Border" sign.  Who would have thought?  But there is something to be said for being able to reflect on good ol' times with a BTTB sweetheart.  We met at age 13/14, and I'm very fortunate to share such fun memories with him, and also for him to understand how much I loved being part of this band.  We mutually agree that this band made our teenage years so memorable and special.   Lisa (McGeorge) Haynes 1983-1987 Colourguard, Bells, Clarinet (I like a challenge)	1985-06-15 00:00:00	358	2007-05-24 22:55:37	0
25	Lets see how many of the original MITB are still around!  Hope to see you all at the reunion.  Being in the Band with you all is a memory I would not trade for anything.  I am not sure I would be where I am today without having been in the BTTB for so long.   .........Allan	1987-12-31 00:00:00	359	2007-05-26 01:59:37	0

314	There are so many great memories of my time in the band like meeting so many great people and going such great places, but I think the one that sticks out the most is going to Japan ( my last tour ) and feeling like a celebrity everyone watned to touch you or take your picture it was really cool and a great tour too.	1987-12-31 00:00:00	361	2007-05-27 23:46:32	0
1455	Mr. Ford's summer free for alls each summer; the wisdom and knowledge he shared are with me to this day. I'll always remember being as silly could be in one moment and then pulling it together with an overwhelming sense of pride and discipline which took hold of  the significance that  we were a part of. We were all a part of some very significant moments.	1975-06-15 00:00:00	363	2007-05-28 11:57:19	0
305	I served in the original band under Elgin Corlett, its founder.   He nurtured me through several instruments -- trumpet, E flat horn and finally, French horn.  With his encouragement, I quickly found myself playing first chair in both the concert and marching band.   Elgin was more than a band leader. He was the type of leader that inspired kids to play better than they thought possible and to be better citizens than they thought possible. His band kids wouldn't let him down because he never let us down.   Many kids undoubtedly became better citizens because of his inspiration and example.	1956-12-31 00:00:00	364	2007-05-29 18:40:46	0

321	In the 1950's there were many more parades than today. The band went out once and sometimes twice each weekend from the middle of June to Labour Day. It was more than a pastime, it was a lifestyle. Waterloo Festival; small town fairs and carnivals; the Waterdown reception for the Bell girl who swam across Lake Ontario; Canadian National Exhibition at the end of every August, and many others. We would do the Orange parade in the second week of July and go out for the Knights of Columbus the next week. I think we must have been lizard-like, since I don't remember feeling hot. I think we marched only once in shirts and hats. Then there were the rehearsals and marching drills with those white lines on the street south of the Lions building. Burlington was a great place for kids. There was hardly any traffic. The most memorable parade to me was the first time we had more than 100 musicians turn out. I think it was the Hamilton Scout Parade in 1956. There was meaningful practice beforehand to keep the ranks tight and I think we marched seven or eight abreast,  more than normal. Everything went fine through the marshalling, until we moved off. All the practice had been in the open but for the parade we were wedged between the stores on James Street North, and the sound richocheted. The 100 players were so loud, and especially the drums, that some of us could not hear our part. By the time we got to King Street it was all sorted out, and I have to say it was a wonderful sound.	1957-12-31 00:00:00	368	2007-06-02 02:05:26	0
331	Pride in being a part of such an amazing organization and of being Canadian!  Whenever I see the band now, I always say, I was in the BTTB.  I still hold great pride in the great expereinces that shaped my teen years. The great music of Mr. Ford, the leadership and friendship with Mr. Allen.  Watching the parade at the Quebec Winter Carnival because I forgot my band pants!Winning Philly!The European trip and being billetted and staying on a pig farm.Eggs left under the pillcases of the boys pillows and not getting caught!Playing in the concert band at Hamilton Place.  So many other great trips, parades and experiences. Lasting friendships and memories......long braids!	1976-06-15 00:00:00	370	2007-06-05 12:31:55	0
334	Matt McNiven and I thought it was such an amazing idea to go on a windsurfing adventure while on tour in Hawaii; so with smiles on our faces, and a sense of adventure and excitement we happily paid one american dollar and took our seats on the bus that would take us to Kailua beach park- Oahu's windsurfing hot spot. With winds gusting into the 20-30 knot range, we rented our gear and prepared ourselves both mentally and physically to master the oceanic playground before us. After 4-5 hours of being taken advantage of by mother nature, thrown about in the madness of the gail force winds and 6' high waves, and not having been able to even pull our sails out of the water- we decided to retire our dream, and head back to land. Much to our surprise, the high quality coppertone sunscreen must have rinsed off in under 15 minutes, because we looked like an expensive dinner entre at red lobster! In addition to that, the sun was so strong that it actually bleached the colour out of a brand new pair of surf shorts I had just purchased! By the way- it was totally worth it.	1997-12-31 00:00:00	373	2007-06-05 17:36:03	0

23411	I had so many unforgettable experiences.  Among the most memorable occasions was attending WWII memorial services in France on the 40th Anniversary of D-Day -1984. I remember seeing parachutists recreate landing on the fields near Caen. My brother Adam playing a solo trumpet tribute and placing a memorial wooden cross in the waters. It was a moving and emotional trip and instilled in us a lasting respect for what previous generations have sacrificed on our behalf.	1982-06-15 00:00:00	388	2007-06-09 23:59:53	0

348	There are so many wonderful memories.   The earliest one is the Band's trip to the Rose Bowl way back when (1969 I think!).  We had the oldest, tattiest uniforms in the whole parade and comments were made about our rather lacklustre outfits.  When we got home - a big fundraising campaign resulted in brand new uniforms which were absolutely great!The Town and residents were such great supporters - and clearly they still are!Second memory - a trip to the Orange Bowl included a stop in DisneyWorld in Orlando.  Somewhere along the way the bus driver was heading the wrong way and decided to turn around -- but had to go across the highway divider -- all grass.  And the bus, with band members aboard got stuck in the median!	1970-06-15 00:00:00	390	2007-06-10 16:31:51	0
349	One of my long lasting memories was when we went to a cemetary filled with Canadian Soldiers in Holland.  Being a WWII vet himself, Mr. Ford was deeply moved.  The Dutch people obviously spend a great deal of time keeping the graves clean and the grounds were immaculate.  It made me feel proud as a Canadian but sad, too, especially when some of the graves were marked "known only to God".   A happy memory was all the singing on the bus.  We sang and sang till we were horse.  Making the tapes from the radio and making up inspirational songs was such fun!!!!!!	1975-06-15 00:00:00	391	2007-06-10 17:55:52	0
323	The band trip to Indiana (Tell City) and one of our stops was a small amusement part with various statue scenes throughout.  Gary, Alf, Bob, myself and few others took the positions of the statues.  Elgin Corlette came along, took one look at us and said he woud deal with us on the bus.  (He never did.)	1963-12-31 00:00:00	392	2007-06-10 23:11:45	0
229	I was on the first executive of the Teen Tour Band the first year that it was formed.If I can find it will bring along a picture of the four of us that appeared in one of the local newpapers.The  back seat club. Remember that last parade, Linda, the grey cup in Ottawa where we slept over that bar with  no lock on our door and a rope in a bag by the window for a fire escape.	1966-06-15 00:00:00	393	2007-06-10 23:18:51	0
352	From the beginning - moving up from the "Peanut Band" 3 wks before Philly (thanks Al Whiskin...) and enduring those practices at the Armoury and the Transit garage.  To the end, and being too scared to tell Mr. Allan it was time to leave...  Fordism's ("Are you from Moscow"), backstage at Disney, Andrew Spicer figuring out the "pattern" in the new music hall, Mr. Garnier's field shows - "It's impossible to rotate a square, but we're going to do it anyways...".  Too bad we can't do it all over again...	1982-12-31 00:00:00	394	2007-06-11 09:51:43	0
355	Some of the happiest times of my life were spent with the Band.  To this day I can't stand listening to the Beatles, thanks to Andrew Hunter & Co on Bus 1 - all the way down to Florida and back again, ugh!  Some of my closest friends to date were made in the Band.  Think once you've been part of a terrific org. like this, it gets under your skin and stays with you for life - I hope one day my Son too will have the pleasure to experience all the Band has to offer; the good, the bad, the laughter and the tears.  Nothing like changing in public and sleeping on gym floors (eating Seagull in France?!) to set a person up for life.  Thank-you BTTB for such wonderful memories (many horrid ones too, but even those are endearing to look back on now!).  Very proud to say I was a Member for so long (even had to be asked to leave, nicely of course, as it was detrimental to Competitions (they say?!  Hummm?!). As several of us were well beyond our 'Teens') - I'll never forget how hard it was to leave something that had become our lives day in and day out (until the wee hours of the morning arranging some of the Social Events and Cleaning up!).  Can't wait to see you all and catch-up - it'll feel like yesterday, when in actual fact it's .... ahhh! (best not work it out, yuk! - I don't feel that old!).  See you over the w/end, travelling all the way from the UK for 4 days - now that's loyalty!	1979-06-15 00:00:00	395	2007-06-11 18:08:40	0

376	During our trip to Alberta for the Calgary Stampede, I fell in the mud at the Columbian Ice Fields.  Covered in very cold mud, I put on a pout.

368	Calgary Stampede parade: We had to move from where we assembled to the start of the parade route, which meant crossing through the parade grounds filled with people.

382	I can remember the feeling of marching in my first July 4th parade, on my very first tour to Baltimore in 1991. The energy from the crowd, and the feeling of marching over "snaps", the small firecrackers that were strewn across the streets, was truly unforgetable  - for a 13 year old kid, this was the real deal!	1991-12-31 00:00:00	409	2007-06-20 16:43:31	0

389	High school? What was that? The Band was the most important thing as a teenager, the friends, the trips, the leadership, the crushes, the Boosters.  What a fantastic way to get through those years.  The smell of white shoe polish on white bucks, garbage bags under our uniforms and frozen instruments in North Bay. Holiday Inn scrambled eggs, ugh.  The phone at the "back of the bus", #1, #2, #3  there must have been more.  Braids, fainting at inspection in the parking lot before the Philly trip. Eaton Santa Claus Parade. Having to stand up for Mr. Ford in concert band practice and still humming the second clarinet part to those classical pieces everytime I hear them.  Band practice was the best night of the week and every weekend getting on the buses to who ever knew where.  Ontario Place sun burns, the Cinesphere movie, Laura and I catching money under the Zipper at the Ex.  The white rabbit, my little brother and the drummers!  Coolest of all.  I get shivers and teary-eyed everytime I see the band and feel 15 again. Too much fun.	1973-07-15 00:00:00	413	2007-07-15 12:41:14	0
396	I moved there with my family from tsawassen bc and was really scared about being so far from home at 15, the band made me feel like i was home.  We did the calgary stampede and klondike days and i had alot of fun.  We moved back to vancouver late october of 82 cause my parents split up, and i sure missed that band.  To this day i try and catch them every year on the santa clause parade.  My daughter is now 15 and i wish she could only have such a great experience.	1982-06-15 00:00:00	414	2007-08-23 07:23:15	0

403	Field shows and concerts were my favourite however here's a few nostalgic moments: * Bob announcing our placement following a parade, and his subtle reminder of  work to be done prior to that next competion if we missed a first. I have a better appreciation for the flak Bob dealt with bearing both good and bad news while  taking wrath for everything that went wrong. Thanks for your guidance in a difficult and thankless role Bob!...  * Eric putting us through the rigors at practice and his keen ear picking up on mistakes, making unfortunate souls pay their pennance in front of everyone, ensuring they learned their part, or realizing they can't hide. This lesson has served me wel in life today and I'm sure Eric continues in spirit to direct our youth. (God Bless and Thank You!)...  * Hey, how about Mr. Allen providing his expertise to the woodwinds and on the side, helping the ticats win a game or two when it was acceptible to have a live band at CFL Games. (Being from Hamilton I thank you!)...  * The Loading Crew and their ability to make everything fit into one truck. Especially our rental at London Heathrow  in 1975 which was meant to be the same size as our truck back home however, I believe it fell a bit short and we had to find a new configuration for everything. (Hello Charlie Parson's / Chas!)...Hey do you think anyone would get security clearance today to get into the bowels of Heathrow and load their own truck? I seem to recall the handlers doubted everything would fit and a couple of pound notes were passed our way?  * The Europeann expericience was amazing especially our fallen heroes in Holland.  * The lack of a washrooms on the buses during our trip from Holland to Gernamy. I still feel sorry for that quaint Cafe receiving 180+ storming their facilities.  * Being back stage at Hamilton place and taking in the big names written on the back of the firewall?  .What a fantastic part of my life and to all, I thank you!	1974-12-31 00:00:00	422	2007-12-04 02:26:24	0
None	The best memory of being in the band was being the first group that went to the Rose Bowl and the Orange Bowl. Marching down the street knowing that we were the first to do that with this band was indeed memorable.	1971-12-31 00:00:00	424	2008-02-05 05:22:46	0

399	Three memories come to mind for me.  Eric Ford (A very talented Man) offering extra encouragement to me as I struggled to play my horn, priceless when you are that young.  Marching in the Toronto Santa Claus Parade and having fingers so cold that they just did not want to move, I can still feel the cold just thinking about it.  The Rosebowl Parade and Disneyland 1970, Long parade route, very hot, but lots of fun.	1969-12-31 00:00:00	430	2008-10-26 01:18:23	0

None	I was the president of the band in my last year and at that time we were the Burlington boys and girls band.  As an executive we decided we wanted to be bigger and better and so we canvased all of the schools for more members and changed the name to the Burlington Tour Band.  One of our first parades was the Windsor Freedom Festival and we were awarded first prize for best band but did not stick around for the trophy prsentation. We did pick it up on the start of our first tour into the United States later that year.. I was proud to be part of the executive that more or less started the Teen Tour Band and proud of what it has become now.	1961-12-31 00:00:00	440	2009-06-06 07:56:48	0

436	My special memory is when i was president of the band and the executive got together and started the first band to be known as the Teen Tour Band.  We worked hard and on out first parade we had over 100 on parade.  Our first trophy win was in Windsor.  The next was seeing my son Bill join the band and seeing him on parade.	1961-12-31 00:00:00	445	2009-12-19 15:16:18	0
9	Philly - definately Philly. What a proud moment to be the first Canadian band to ever set foot in the competition - let alone win four perfect scores!!  From the high stepping bucks flashing on the field, to the (hear a pin drop) audience totally focused in amazement, thanks to Eric Ford music. They weren't expecting this from Canada. Who are these Red Coats? And - the home coming - tear in your eye and lump in your throat stuff. Coming home to the largest crowd lining the streets and Music Centre driveway I have ever seen. It seemed like miles of people, from parents and supporters, to residents who just wanted scream, "Who's number One?"  Yes, definately Philly!	1972-06-15 00:00:00	446	2010-07-12 14:57:01	0

13633	Lifetime of memories include many hours on busses and sleeping in the luggage rack.

443	There are lots of special memories of my time in the band.  In particular the year we went to PEI for their centennial the ferry service went on strike.  We had to get up in the middle of the night to line up in our bus in hopes of getting a ride back to the mainland.Music has been special part of my life and songs we marched to are always popping up on the radio and taking me back to those wonderful memories.	1971-12-31 00:00:00	455	2011-05-12 08:29:50	0
444	Holland 95 stands out as one of the greatest times.  Monkey ball soup, marking time for later lights out, the Dutch people, the Veterans, being one of Mrs. Orlowski's little piglets.  It was an amazing experience, I still watch the video from time to time and it always makes me smile.  I met a lot of great friends in the band and some still remain great friends.  It truly is an amazing organization and I hold many memories close to my heart.	1996-06-15 00:00:00	456	2011-06-14 10:30:24	0

450	My favourite tours were probably attending the 60th Anniversary of D-Day in France and marching the Rose Bowl parade in California. My "special memory" in particular is hands down speaking with veterans. I've gained so many amazing lifelong friends while in band, and the lessons I've learned I will take with me wherever I go. The stories I'll have to tell, the emotions I've felt and the beauty I've seen will stay with me for the rest of my life!	2005-06-15 00:00:00	459	2012-01-17 22:58:58	0

492	The chills down the back of my neck when we would play the Stars and Stripes Forever March, heading into the diminuendo into the piccolo feature in the Trio section, and the audience would stop talking... Magic! This happened whether we were parading in small town Ontario for three families and some cows on the roadside or down the main Mall in Washington or Philadelphia.	1986-06-15 00:00:00	462	2012-03-26 15:40:07	0

0	At the end of one of the parades the rain was teeming down so hard that we were literally marking time in knee-deep puddles. We of the loading crew boldly stayed out in the rain to make sure everything was properly stored back on the truck while everyone else ran to take cover in the buses. Shortly after this marked the appearance of the infamous rain capes.	1982-07-04 00:00:00	464	2012-04-29 15:29:23	0

29666	I have three very specific fond memories of the band ... I'll try to be brief. The first is standing on the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art and Modern History as we were being marshalled for the 1968 Gimbel's Thankgiving Day Parade and watching the parade wind its way into downtown Philly. The second, turning the corner onto Colorado Boulevard in Pasedena on New Year's Day 1970 into the brighter-than-daylight studio lighting that both NBC and CBS had set up for their broadcasts as we played an Eric Ford arrangement of Give Us a Place to Stand (Ontario theme song). The third and perhaps my fondest memory is from when I was no longer in the band but, managed to travel with them to Philadelphia as a Guest/Chaperone/Corupter? and watched them perform in and win their first Parade of Champions competition after having endured USMC inspections and several hours of pre-performance hype. It was a great night!	1967-12-31 00:00:00	468	2012-06-05 14:46:28	0
406	There are so many but think the best was being in the first Rose Bowl parade in California. That being the first time that the band had gone it was incredible. Second only to being in the Orange Bowl and marching down the streets of Disney World which had just opened up that year.	1971-12-31 00:00:00	469	2012-10-28 12:49:37	0

407	There are so many memories I wish I could put them all!Myrtle Beach 2006 was amazing, on the bus ride there we got lost, but it didn't matter, we were all having so much fun on the bus. I remember when 'Hey Ya' was playing and we all shook it like a Polaroid picture. During practice on the beach we were doing a counter march (I think that's the right term, you bandies know what I mean, when the whole band files through each other to turn around), well I wasn't all there and in my daze I smashed right into a bass drum, getting knocked down with my bell set smashing on top of me. Drumline laughed at me and I was so embarrassed, I received a nasty gash on my arm from the collision, now it's a tasty lookin' scar, that I now look at and smile, because it's my permanent reminder of everything I went through with the band and my band family. Also Holland 2005 was Amazing. Getting lost in Amsterdam with my group. The Monkey Zoo and having monkeys clamber all over us. Staying in the army barracks. Shoppin' in the outdoor market... The whole trip was an unforgettable experience.	2004-12-31 00:00:00	475	2013-04-19 08:54:55	0

475	I had the best years of my life while in the band, I made great friends and learned to play auto sax much better than I could ever have imagined! Every trip we took had lasting memories!

476	Too many amazing memories to choose from my 4+ years with the BTTB. The unreal friendships made over those years will always be incredibly special in my life and of course touring around the world still holds such a wonderful place in my heart. My first tour to Hawaii in 1992 for the 50th Anniversary of Pearl Harbour was such an incredible time and of course our Holland Tour in 1995 for the Liberation Celebrations (50th as well) still leaves me with shivers. The unreal support from boosters and parents and seeing those Canadian flags while travelling abroad I will always remember giving us such strength when we were on parade. Nothing quite like that 1st drum roll-off and the power of the band ready to "Strike Up The Band".	1993-06-15 00:00:00	484	2015-05-20 16:37:15	0
478	Too many to name!! Met some amazing friends and had some amazing experiences. I remember when I was appointed section leader, all my friends freaked out to congratulate me and my co-section leader came up to me and patted me on the back, and essentially said "good luck" haha	2005-06-15 00:00:00	485	2015-07-15 13:09:27	0
None	Downing half a bottle of brandy (aged 16) and then doing a 7 mile parade though slush and snow at Bon Homme Carnival, Quebec City. It was so cold that all the brass instruments froze and the drum head split. Great fun!	1968-12-31 00:00:00	486	2015-07-24 10:34:19	0
481	Spring trip to Indiana, ( Vincennes, Bloomington, Anderson, Elkhart, Warren Ohio) Probably one of the youngest to play in the band with Tommy Corlett.  We stayed with Jane Anne Rutledge, future Miss America when in Vincennes. learning to play in Burlington with Elgin Corlett gave me so many wonderful opportunities, playing for Bob Hope, Billy Eckstein, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame member Rufus Thomas, soloist @ Walter Payton's memorial service at Soldier Field, Chicago Illinois, and many many more special gigs and recording opportunities.  Incredible.	1958-12-31 00:00:00	487	2016-02-29 16:50:08	0
31236	My time in Ireland when I made a spaz out of myself by slipping up the stairs at the Burlington Hotel and landing at the feet of a Priest.  I should point out to everyone that at the time I was my high-school kilt (short to begin with) with the regulation navy blue knee high socks (double duty - good for marching and school!).  I believe that poor old gent got more than he bargained for.  Ask Jen Brown, but I must have gone about 18 shades of red while pulling down my kilt back into place (Band mates seeing you in your underwear - okay, but complete strangers...yikes!).	1986-06-15 00:00:00	488	2016-03-04 17:37:59	0

21607	Lots of good memories, but it is the people that I remember the most. The friendships that were established at practices, parades, tours, and competitions. Europe, Quebec, Orange Bowl, Bi-Centennial, Rose Bowl, Philly ........ Anyone remember the time the drum section "went on strike?" Bob Webb was NOT amused!	1977-06-15 00:00:00	491	2016-11-02 11:05:43	0

489	My favorite trip was of course Hawaii, but I loved the long bus trips where we would have contests between all the buses and listen to sound bites of songs to see who could guess the most. Then there was a very special Mom who gave me a little ceramic turtle cause it seemed like I was always the last one getting off the bus!!	1988-12-31 00:00:00	493	2016-11-06 22:23:04	0
0	The endless Rosebowl parade route . Even though it was so long we were so well prepared that we hardly noticed the difference. Mile after mile of people deeper than the grandstand at most other parades pumped us up so much that we could have marched all day!	1980-01-01 00:00:00	494	2016-11-27 22:51:06	0
493	Falling down during field show practice in California for the Rose Parade in 2008. Falling backwards and ending up with my quads hitting me in the face. Then seeing Andy Fur, Dustin (Drum Major, Can't remember his last name) and Rob Bennett running towards me. Andy gets there first, I get up, ask him if I have all my teeth and If i'm bleeding. Yes I'm bleeding, and all my teeth are still there. I ask for a tissue and get back into my place and finish the field show.	2008-12-31 00:00:00	495	2017-01-03 21:25:03	0

431	when we were in Amsterdam staying at the hostel, Mr Allan in a playful manor said if we marked time for 15 mins he would extend our curfew by an hour.  This turned into a song and dance, we all sang songs while marking time and we did this for almost an hour it was so fun!	1996-06-15 00:00:00	497	2017-02-28 12:47:33	0

132	Missing the band bus from Expo 67 to our Montreal dormitory and (with others) having to take the Metro, the last bus, followed by a 5? mile walk to reach the dormitory (school) at 3:00 AM, only to be met Charlie Parsons. Our punishment was to "volunteer" to help load up everything at 5:00 AM - long night!	1965-06-15 00:00:00	500	2017-03-13 12:30:38	0

347	Marching in the rain in Philly. My mom was a chaperone and she still tears up at the memory of us entering the stadium, in perfect straight lines, diagonals and everything, through the downpour and 3 inches of rain on the track.	1981-06-15 00:00:00	502	2017-03-19 13:45:29	0
0	Marching in the Toronto Santa Clause parade in the Euphonium section when Laurel Huffman's bell somehow loosened and fell off. Too bad this was in the days before ubiquitous phone cameras.	1979-11-22 00:00:00	503	2017-04-07 21:56:49	0
455	Amazing times with amazing people! Life lessons and great experiences! California rose bowl best parade, Holland(amsterdam) was a blast and got lost, France was my first tour and will never forget being on juno beach with the veterans and playing "in the mood" and seeing the veterans start dancing was amazing. Myrtle Beach was a massive party. You guys know who you are! Dixie land jambori, Hollywood milestones, land, lion king, disney at the movies were my favorite songs to play.   Miss band a lot but certainly not the rain capes!	2017-04-08 00:00:00	504	2017-04-08 03:13:03	0

455	I remember getting into trouble quite a bit for playing way to loud and improvising but it was so much fun. I remember field show practice in california(2008) the whole band sitting in the stands playing land of 1000 dances. I was sitting beside Leo and we were playing our hearts out and there is actually a picture of us both with massive grins on our faces while playing. You could see how into the music we were and I will never forget that feeling.	2017-04-11 00:00:00	510	2017-04-11 14:40:51	0
