        'Compared favourably with Norman Rockwell, this talented Canadian has
        been praised for his ability to create consistently, uncannily, a
        feeling of familiarity in the beholder - as though these warm and
        cozy images are a glimpse at our very own lives. When feelings of
        our own childhood experiences or thoughts of our beloved children
        are instantly, magically delivered, more than a mere glance is
        invited.' Memories of Childhood, the Art of John Newby,

        <h2>What is a Giclee?</h2>
        <p>
        Limited edition Giclee prints combine very high resolution printing
        on canvas and on acid-free papers. Pigment-based inks are used which
        produce a superior archival print. Next to the original, a properly
        produced Giclee print is the finest method available today of
        representing the artist’s original work.
        </p>
