<h1>Website Development</h1>
<p>
This is a list of all planned and potential web development, more or less in
the order it will happen. If you have more ideas or would like to see
something done a little sooner than planned then <a class="email"
href="mailto:bttb@picott.ca?Subject=Website Idea">send your ideas
to the webmaster</a>.

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><i>Pic/Memory of the week/day</i> on homepage</td>
		<td>
		A constantly changing image or story taken randomly from the <i>Memory
		Lane</i> section, designed to give a reason for people to return to
		the web page every so often (which in turn is to ensure they keep
		thinking about and looking forward to the celebration).
		</td>
		<td>Get a critical mass of material in Memory Lane so that the content
		will vary regularly (say 20 images and 10 stories)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Google map alumni mashup</td>
		<td>
		Google maps can be combined with address information to provide a
		world map where each alumni member has a marker representing their
		current location (to whatever resolution they are willing to share).
		Shows people how the influence of the band has spread around the
		world. Include parade route information for SOMF, and music centre
		location.
		</td>
		<td>Some background work required to figure out how to do this, then
		to figure out how to let people gauge how much detail they will
		share.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Google map performance mashup</td>
		<td>
		Similar to the above but adding a pin for every place the band
		has performed over the years. Secondary idea to allow members to
		type in any special memories local to that performance.
		</td>
		<td>Getting initial population data from Rob Bennett, or the
		collective memory of the committee.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Live Forum</td>
		<td>Set up interactive bulletin-board style forums where people can
		communicate with each other through the website.
		</td>
		<td>Need to find a suitable drop-in component and figure out how to
		hook it up to existing pages. Login required first as forums should
		disallow anonymous posting.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Fun and Games</td>
		<td>
		The web is chock full of little games and such you can post onto your
		own website. Alternatively we can come up with our own that are more
		BTTB-specific. The idea is that people not only come back to visit the
		website regularly but also enjoy doing it. Ideas could include
		crosswords, word-search, sudoku, trivia, picture identification,
		just-for-fun polls, band acronyms/sayings, etc.
		</td>
		<td>Need a variety of things ready to go before introducing it -
		possibly a commitment to populate any home-grown games</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Committee link to send email to groups</td>
		<td>
		A web link for committee members which will open up a mail program
		with the email addresses of sub-groups of alumni (e.g. all those
		wanting to play in the concert band) pre-populated.  Makes it easier
		to target any communications going out to those to which it pertains
		</td>
		<td>None - Can do any time</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class='done'>Music and Video Clips</td>
		<td class='done'>
		We have a collection of music and video clips that could be made
		available. Space restrictions on the website make it impractical to
		load everything at once but it should be possible to have a select
		"clip of the day/week"
		</td>
		<td class='done'>Finish the rearrangement of navigation buttons to allow for a
		music player on the front page.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class='done'>Online purchase of event packages</td>
		<td class='done'>
		The ability to peruse the list of event packages we're going to offer
		for sale (e.g. the all-inclusive "Strike up the Band package" for $8
		billion, which includes your very own band complete with uniforms,
		coaches, music director, and a lifetime pass to McDonalds). By having
		advance purchase available we'll be more comfortable with the budget
		we're setting.
		</td>
		<td class='done'>Need Boosters to set up PayPal - it's the best option since you
		can pay directly with a credit card now even without a PayPal
		account. Since we're a subcommittee they have to be the ones to set it
		up. Rates range from 0.9% to 2.9% of the transaction fee.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class='done'>Committee Query List</td>
		<td class='done'>
		Add in queries to answer these questions:
		<li>List duplicate entries</li>
		<li>Cleanup duplicate entry</li>
		<li>List of everyone signed up for the parade</li>
		<li>List of everyone who has paid for something</li>
		</td>
		<td class='done'>Can do any time.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class='done'>Committee Profiles</td>
		<td class='done'>Introduce the committee to the alumni at large via profile
		information and hopefully pictures. Put a face on the work going on
		to make the celebration happen.
		</td>
		<td class='done'>Need a spot for the button.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class='done'>Memorials Page</td>
		<td class='done'>
		Add in a page to honour deceased alumni.
		</td>
		<td class='done'>Need a spot for this.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class='done'>Committee Query Page</td>
		<td class='done'>
		Currently there's only one hardcoded query - to download everything
		onto a single spreadsheet. A new page will be created that allows
		committee members to select from a set of queries to create results
		for viewing or download, including the ability to edit the database
		query directly (most likely just to paste a query I provide for a
		specific purpose).
		</td>
		<td class='done'>Need the button reorg for a spot for this.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class='done'>Wallace B. Wallace</td>
		<td class='done'>
		Add in the ability for people to submit Wallace B. Wallace winners and
		anecdotes for various years.
		</td>
		<td class='done'>Not dependent on anything.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class='done'>"NEW" flags on news</td>
		<td class='done'>
		Adding flags to the news articles on the home page to mark what
		has changed since the last time the person visited (obviously will
		only work for people who have logged in).
		</td>
		<td class='done'>Verify information for visit dates and create a "NEW" icon for
		display.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class='done'>Memory Lane section</td>
		<td class='done'>
		Expansion of the current registration request to share a memory to
		allow uploading of stories, pictures, video, or audio clips (subject
		to size limitations of the website) for people to share in order to
		help promote the feeling of a community with common experiences.
		</td>
		<td class='done'>Get a critical mass of stuff collected before making it live.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class='done'>Music and Video Clips</td>
		<td class='done'>
		Add the ability on the home page to have a look at a video or listen
		to band music.
		</td>
		<td class='done'>Get some music/video clips available. New menus in place.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class='done'>Painting Orders</td>
		<td class='done'>Allow people to order paintings in advance, charging to PayPal or
		providing an order form for them to print and mail in with a cheque.
		Committee page should allow assignment of a print ID to orders, with
		allowances for reservation of certain low-number IDs for raffles,
		donations, etc.
		</td>
		<td class='done'>Need Boosters to set up PayPal.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class='done'>News database</td>
		<td class='done'>
		Keep track of front page news items in a database so that it can be
		updated by anybody, and so that we can hide all of the articles a
		returning alumni has already seen.
		</td>
		<td class='done'>Requires a login so that we can associate what they've seen with
		who they are.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class='done'>Pre-ordering of commissioned art</td>
		<td class='done'>
		Using the name alone and the subject of the prints there may be early
		interest in pre-ordering the work that John Newby will eventually get
		done for us. Since being able to sell all 450 prints is a high-risk
		proposition it's in our best interests to make it as easy as possible
		to get the art ordered, possibly offering some kind of discount
		depending on how far in advance you order (biggest before you actually
		see the work of course).
		</td>
		<td class='done'>Should roll out when event package purchase options are available
		(and be one of them). Can't be visible until price and final detail
		on the prints are available.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class='done'>Music Download</td>
		<td class='done'>
		Provide a method for people signed up for the parade and/or concert
		to download appropriate music parts. Susie will gauge the parade
		part coverage, make sure all parts are filled. People will a) request
		parts, giving their name, b) get approved by Susie, and c) be sent a
		link where they can download the sheet music.  A similar task for the
		concert coverage will be given out to someone later.
		</td>
		<td class='done'>Must have all music converted from scans to PDF files.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class='done'>Navigation Button Reorganization</td>
		<td class='done'>
		The magic number of navigational links is 7 - once you get more than
		that the interface becomes hard to use. Proposed changes take us
		beyond that so at some point it will be desirable to rearrange the
		navigation to make it simpler to find things. Simultaneously an image
		pre-load will be added to speed up the page in general.
		Items to be handled include:
		<li>Shrinking of the logo to provide more screenspace (with dynamic
		grow)</li>
		<li>New graphics for the menu</li>
		<li>Submenu capabilities so that everything can still be accessed from
		a single location</li>
		<li>Login request at the bottom of the menu</li>
		</td>
		<td class='done'>Wait for basic functionality, use this when extras are being added.
		Need anticipated site map and associated menu graphics.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class='done'>Alumni info editing</td>
		<td class='done'>
		Allow the alumni to edit their own information, including profile
		data, adding their own memories, allowing certain profile information
		to be visible to others.
		</td>
		<td class='done'>Requires a login so that we can verify who they are. Also requires
		a smarter setup in the database that allows rollback in case somebody
		messes things up.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class='done'>Database Conversion</td>
		<td class='done'>Switch profile data from its current setup to be inside a live
		database. Will fix slow loading of home page, and allow the Memory Lane
		section to be created faster. As a backup all of the data will have
		the ability to be dumped out into the file system, similar but not
		identical to how it exists now.
		</td>
		<td class='done'>Need database and login set up on server.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class='done'>Login</td>
		<td class='done'>Allow people to enter the site with identification so that they
		can post things and we'll know who they are, or we know exactly what
		they have permission to change so that e.g. profile changes don't
		require our intervention.
		</td>
		<td class='done'>Need to balance the automation with extra effort logging in
		requires. So far there is no pressing need for this, but it is an
		option if required.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class='done'>Page rearrangement</td>
		<td class='done'>The page locator technology makes loading faster but at the
		expense of some intermittent page refresh problems. This should
		be alleviated before the bulk of the site is exposed to the alumni at
		large.
		</td>
		<td class='done'>None - can do any time</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class='done'>Add event attendance to profiles</td>
		<td class='done'>
		A tickmark column in the profile pages indicating which
		of the 60<sup>th</sup> celebration events each person is attending.
		By having this more accessible people might be encouraged to make
		arrangements ahead of time to meet up.
		</td>
		<td class='done'>None - Can do any time</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class='done'><i>Newest additions</i> on main page</td>
		<td class='done'>
		Couple of lines on the home page that say who the last (5?) people to
		sign up are. Reinforces the activity happening as more and more people
		find out about the celebration.
		</td>
		<td class='done'>None - Can do any time</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class='done'>Notify co-chair when someone signs up</td>
		<td class='done'>Automatically send an email to Ron when there is a new
		registration or edit on the website so that it can be approved
		as quickly as possible.</td>
		<td class='done'>Not sure if the website server supports auto-email yet</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class='done'>Steering Committee profiles/information</td>
		<td class='done'>
		Separate page with bios on the steering committee members. Puts a face
		on the organization and helps people relate more.
		</td>
		<td class='done'>As soon as it's available it can be posted - I can
		start with contact information and go from there.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class='done'>Committee link to download data to Excel</td>
		<td class='done'>
		A web link which dumps the alumni database into a tab-delimited
		file for download onto your own computer. Contains a header row so
		it's suitable for Excel calculations or Word forms.
		</td>
		<td class='done'>None - Can do any time</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Countdown to events</td>
		<td>
		Simple numeric countdown image on the main page indicating how long it
		is until the next event happens. Guarantees at least something is
		changing on the webpage regularly.
		</td>
		<td>Need a suitable design for location and appearance</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class='done'>Profile sorting usability</td>
		<td class='done'>
		Put some highlighting and a direction indicator in the currently
		sorted column - maintain the previous sort methods as secondary
		sorting (starting with FirstYear/LastName).
		</td>
		<td class='done'>None - Can do anytime.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class='done'>Music Survey sorting</td>
		<td class='done'>
		Show the survey results in order of number of votes.
		</td>
		<td class='done'>None - Can do anytime.</td>
