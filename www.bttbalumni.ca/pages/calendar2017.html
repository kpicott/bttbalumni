<h1>70th Reunion Calendar of Events</h1>
<p>
As every band member knows the itinerary of a tour is only final when it's
over, so here is the always-tentative order of events for the weekend.
Central Arena will be our headquarters for the weekend starting on Friday
so if in doubt go there first.
