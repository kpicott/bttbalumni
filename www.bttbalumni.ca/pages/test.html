Concert Drumline
<p>
For the first time ever, drumline alumni will have the opportunity to participate in the
Concert in the Park! For alumni from the drumline who wish to participate, there is the
option to perform in a part of the BTTB drum feature. The music can be downloaded using
the link below. Rehearsal times with the drumline will take place at the same time as the
rest of the ensemble (Wednesday the 14th and Sunday the 18th).

A Message To The Colour Guard From Robyn Garnier
<p>
Ok my guard alumni...since it's the 70th what do you think of trying to get as many of us
70/80's guard together and having a rocking flag line (just like the old days). I am not in
touch with everyone, so get on your contacts and spread the word. Think of how great it could
be! Tammy, Sandy, Sara, Michelle, Kelly , Jennifer , Lorraine, Kim, Laurie, Lori, Janine,
Michelle, Debbie,  just to name a few. We were an awesome guard...just think of how great this
would look one last time. Pass it on and I hope to see you there......
